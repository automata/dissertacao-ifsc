@Article{slic,
   abstract    = {Computer vision applications have come to rely
                 increasingly on superpixels in recent years, but it is
                 not always clear what constitutes a good superpixel
                 algorithm. In an effort to understand the benefits and
                 drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare
                 five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their
                 ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory
                 efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance.
                 We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple
                 linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a
                 k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate
                 superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to
                 boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At
                 the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient,
                 improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward
                 to extend to supervoxel generation.},

  abstract={The development of new statistical and computational methods is increasingly making it possible to bridge the gap between hard sciences and humanities. In this study, we propose an approach based on a quantitative evaluation of attributes of objects in fields of humanities, from which concepts such as dialectics and opposition are formally defined mathematically. As case studies, we analyzed the temporal evolution of classical music and philosophy by obtaining data for 8 features characterizing the corresponding fields for 7 well-known composers and philosophers, which were treated with multivariate statistics and pattern recognition methods. A bootstrap method was applied to avoid statistical bias caused by the small sample data set, with which hundreds of artificial composers and philosophers were generated, influenced by the 7 names originally chosen. Upon defining indices for opposition, skewness and counter-dialectics, we confirmed the intuitive analysis of historians in that classical music evolved according to a master–apprentice tradition, while in philosophy changes were driven by opposition. Though these case studies were meant only to show the possibility of treating phenomena in humanities quantitatively, including a quantitative measure of concepts such as dialectics and opposition, the results are encouraging for further application of the approach presented here to many other areas, since it is entirely generic.}
